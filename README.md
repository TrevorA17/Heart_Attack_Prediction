# Heart Attack Prediction
Welcome to the Heart Attack Prediction Project! This project endeavors to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical attributes. The dataset used encompasses demographic, clinical, and laboratory information of individuals, serving as the foundation for training this predictive model. Utilizing advanced techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, the aim is to provide accurate predictions. Additionally, a Plumber API endpoint has been implemented to facilitate user-friendly predictions. Whether you're a healthcare professional, researcher, or individual concerned about heart health, this project offers valuable insights and tools for early detection and prevention of heart attacks. Dive into the repository to explore the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment methodologies. The goal is to contribute to the advancement of cardiovascular health through data-driven approaches!
